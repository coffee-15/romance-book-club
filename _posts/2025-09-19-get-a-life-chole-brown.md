This one was a throwback pick from Liv, as most of the group has actually read it already. Liv chose it as it's a personal favourite, with cosy vibes and a protagonist whose disability is different from your usual leading ladies.

## Anja: 3/5
Anja liked the book but is most excited to get to book 3 of the Brown sister trilogy - poor Chloe is not the most compelling for her.

## Liv: 3/5

## Jess: 3/5

## Nicola: 3/5

## Charlotte: 3/5
While she enjoyed it the first time, Charlotte felt on the re-read it just didn't work for her. "Too twee" was her main point, with the sugary sweet romance between Chloe and Red feeling a bit too gooey to be real. She thinks the leads still have good chemistry on re-read, but that the enemies to lovers of it all just didn't quite hit - Charlotte wants a little bit more zing before the puppy dog eyes come to the fore.

This one was a throwback pick from Liv, as most of the group has actually read it already. Liv chose it as it's a personal favourite, with cosy vibes and a protagonist whose experience is different from your usual leading ladies.

## Anja: 5/5
Anja has actually submitted her own written review:

"Admittedly, I have read this book about 12 times. It's a huge comfort read for me. Red is one of my favourite book boyfriends. He makes me want a mild-mannered, blue-collar guy, and I love that the ending is them backpacking the world together. The spice is on point; in the audiobook, Lady Danbury was voice acting with her whole Dabussy.

Most of all, Red and Chloe's relationship felt very sweet and real. They're both imperfect. Their big fight isn't because of miscommunication, a trope I fucking hate (they're actually both really good communicators and set boundaries throughout the book); it's because Red has put off mental health treatment after coming out of an abusive relationship, and like, that's a real thing.

And Chloe is so cute. I like that she's chubby, and while I'm not an expert on it, it feels like good disability representation.

My main qualm is that, to Char's point, the book is very twee. I rewrote pretty much every outfit Chloe wore in my head. Also, minor point, but it's very 2010s hipster that Red and Chloe make a big deal about his "vegan leather biker jacket" when PLASTIC LEATHER IS WAY WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN SECONDHAND LEATHER"

## Liv: 3/5

## Jess: 3/5

## Nicola: 3/5

## Charlotte: 2.5/5
While she enjoyed it the first time, Charlotte felt on the re-read it just didn't work for her. "Too twee" was her main point, with the sugary sweet romance between Chloe and Red feeling a bit too gooey to be real. She thinks the leads still have good chemistry on re-read, but that the enemies to lovers of it all just didn't quite hit - Charlotte wants a little bit more zing before the puppy dog eyes kick in.

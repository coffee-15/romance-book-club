This proved to be a tricky time of year for book club, with half the club overwhlemed with the end of year dash to get everything done before the holiday period. As such, Anja and Charlotte didn't even finish the book (boo!). The Devil She Knows was Jess' pick, chosen for it's fun devilish lesbian love interest.

## Anja: 3/5
Anja was super busy and just barely managed to get over the line on this one, with the help of a 1.5x speed audiobook copy. Anja found the book frustrating in its promise - she found the core premise and plot interesting, but felt the limited perspective of Sam brought the whole thing down. Anja thought it would have been a much more compelling story from devilish Daphne's perspective, as her backstory and personality was the most fleshed out and unqiue. She did note that despite much frustration with Sam (likening her to the much hated protagonist of What Happens in Amsterdam) both leads discovering they were gay after falling for their best friends was real.

## Liv: 3/5
A solid, dependable 3 was Liv's feeling - not too bad, but not outstanding either. Liv's fave was also Daphne, whose no nonsense attitude and one liners gave some much needed balance to Sam's "dumb" choices. Liv also enjoyed the wishes and the cooking show section, finding them to be fun set-ups. She found the book to be mixed throughout, with the ending in particular standing out as quite unsatisfying.


## Jess: 2.5/5
While it was her pick, Jess turned out to be this book's harshest critic (much like Charlotte and her pick!). She found tghe characters to be uneven and some downright grating, noting that she felt she "could have written better dialogue than this". She loved the premise of the novel, and maybe that's why there was so much disappointment - with stronger characters and tighter plotting Jess felt this could have been a gem. As our resident legal expert, Jess also noted that the contract seemed pretty sketchy, and was shocked Sam didn't even read it!

## Nicola: 3.5/5
Nicola was a bit softer than the rest of the group, sharing similar complaints but finiding that the food-porn energy and cooking segments were charming enough to keep her engaged. She found that the chemistry in the book was good throughout, with a compelling dynamic between Sam and Daphne. Outside of those two however, Nic noted that the supporting cast felt flat, especially compared to complex Daphne.

## Charlotte: 3/5
Charlotte was the busiest of the group this month and managed to be the only member to DNF a book. Because of this, she got through the first third, and broadly agreed with the others on the pacing and awkward dialogue. Charlotte thought that a split perspective could have given the book more momentum, and allowed Daphne's complex interior life to come to the fore much earlier.

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Our next pick is the newly released novel by romance writer Rachel Lynn Solomon, <em>What Happens in Amsterdam</em>. Charlotte chose this book as she’s previously enjoyed Solomon’s writing, but the group gave it mixed reviews. One great thing is that the books was certainly <em>spicy</em> - a good counter to our more tame first two choices.</p>

<h2 id="anja-35">Anja 3/5</h2>
<p>Anja found the main lead Dani to be quite annoying, but felt that the books loving description of Amsterdam made it worthwhile. Anja has visted several times (she has family in the Netherlands) and extra-appreciated the way Solomon captured the intrinsic blunt Dutch-ness of the main male lead, as well as doing great job of showing off a culture and people that are maybe seen as less traditionally ‘sexy’.</p>

<h2 id="liv-355">Liv 3.5/5</h2>
<p>Liv (in a reversal of our first review) was the member who most enjoyed the book! She enjoyed the chemistry between the main leads, and admittedly has a soft spot for childhood friends to lovers/reunited tropes. She liked that the character was flawed, but did find the descriptions of anxiety and asthma attacks quite far off her own experiences. Like Anja, she too loved the Dutch-ness of it all, and agrees with Dani that stroopwaffle is the best.</p>

<h2 id="jess-15">Jess 1/5</h2>
<p>Jess positively loathed our main character Dani - describing her as ‘annoying’ and ‘irritating’. Yikes! Jess did too enjoy the Dutch setting, but found Dani to be such a turn off that she wouldn’t have finished the book if not for book club. She also noted that the pacing was quite off, with the back half really dragging.</p>

<h2 id="nicola-25">Nicola 2/5</h2>
<p>Nicola, too, found Dani to be annoying (a theme, it seems) but having been to Amsterdam herself had more fondness for the setting. She liked Wouter’s sister and family, and found them to be a welcome addition to the dynamic.</p>

<h2 id="charlotte-15">Charlotte 1/5</h2>
<p>For a book that was her pick, Charlotte really didn’t like it either! She found Dani to be grating, with very few redeemable features as a character. She vibed better with Woulter, but then found herself stewing that such a nice, kind guy would spend that much time with a woman that comes across as entirely too self-absorbed in every percieved slight. She didn’t really click with the setting too, finding that it felt like an attempt to paper over the poor character writing, and resented how much of the book became ‘Amsterdam is neat!’. A harsh critic, Charlotte is.</p>

      <p>This one was an interesting first choice in terms of response, with some members loving it, and others quite the opposite.</p>

<h2 id="anja-35">Anja: 3/5</h2>

<p>Pros: I am her. She is me. Her happy ending (dream job, work life balance, maximum slayage) feels truly earned, and thus instils hope for burnout victims everywhere. Ily Sasha.</p>

<p>Cons: So are we just not going to explain the colleague’s weird phone call?? Also he says he broke up with his girlfriend of TEN YEARS “ages ago”, but it was two months before they met?? Not enough character development for Finn. Not enough grovelling. Not enough smut either, let’s see this man work for our girl thank yeww.</p>

<h2 id="liv-25">Liv: 2/5</h2>

<p>Liv enjoyed the side characters of the book, particularly the young receptionist who sewed naughty knickers on the job. Her main complaint was with Sasha - she couldn’t stand her! A major point against any book, no matter the genre.</p>

<h2 id="jess-35">Jess: 3/5</h2>

<p>Jess similarly liked the side characters, and found Sasha’s mad dash away from her job particularly inspired. Her other highlight was the mother and auntie, who both felt crazy in relatable ways.</p>

<h2 id="nicola-355">Nicola: 3.5/5</h2>

<p>Nic found the core romance satifying but overall wished for <em>more</em>. More romance, more smut, more time with each lead. She found the ending with Terry genuinely touching, but wasn’t sure the subplot with the couple on the beach really added as much in comparison.</p>

<h2 id="charlotte-355">Charlotte 3.5/5</h2>

<p>Char genuninely enjoyed the book, and her highlight was the humour throughout - while it could be cheesy at times it never felt like it was punching down. The standout for her was the focus on Sasha’s recovery, and the humanity of her eternal struggle in comparing herself to Wetsuit Girl. As someone who has had career stress in the past, parts were very relatable.</p>
